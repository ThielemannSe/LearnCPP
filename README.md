# Learning CPP!

This is a small course for learning C++.

## Function overloading

C++ allows to provide multiple definitions for a certain function. This method
is called ***function overloading***.

The following chapter gives a small introduction to this topic.


Let's create a function for printing an integer to the console.

```cpp

    using namespace std;

    void print(int a)
    {
        cout << a << endl;
    }


```
